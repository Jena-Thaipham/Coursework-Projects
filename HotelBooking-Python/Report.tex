\textbf{\large Abstract}
\\
The hospitality industry, particularly hotel booking platforms, plays a pivotal role in the travel and tourism sector. Understanding customer preferences, and booking patterns, and predicting hotel bookings are crucial for optimizing business operations and enhancing customer satisfaction. In this report, we present an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prediction model for hotel bookings using Python. We leverage multiple datasets, specifically focusing on hotel booking demand and weather data, to analyze booking trends and customer behavior to develop a predictive model to forecast future hotel bookings. Through this analysis, we aim to provide valuable insights for hotel management and booking platforms to improve service offerings and optimize resource allocation.
