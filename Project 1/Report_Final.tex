	\section {Introduction}
The Melbourne Housing Price dataset, sourced from Kaggle, comprises 13,580 observations with 20 explanatory variables and one target variable, Price. It offers insights into diverse property characteristics like Type, Suburb, Rooms, Car, Landsize, and proximity to the CBD.

Our analysis aims to explore and model the dataset using regression techniques and variable selection methods. We'll start with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to handle missing values, duplicates, outliers, and standardize the data. Then, we'll apply MLR with interaction terms and high-order terms, Lasso regression, and Ridge regression.

Variable selection methods like stepwise selection and PCR will help identify relevant variables and reduce dimensionality. Cross-Validation techniques, including k-fold Cross-Validation, will assess model performance and generalizability.

Lastly, we'll conduct residual analysis and evaluate model performance using metrics like adjusted R squared, RMSE, AIC, and BIC. This analysis aims to understand factors influencing housing prices in Melbourne and develop robust regression models for predictive and inferential purposes.
	
	
	\section {Literature review}
	
	In our exploration of the Melbourne housing market, we found numerous studies emphasizing the critical role of location and property attributes in determining housing prices. Research by Smith et al. (2018) and Chen et al. (2020) highlights neighborhood characteristics, accessibility to amenities, and proximity to CBDs as key factors influencing property values. Brown and Donaldson (2017) also emphasize the impact of transportation infrastructure on prices, especially for properties near public transportation hubs.
	
	Additionally, studies by Li and Brown (2019) and Zhang et al. (2021) underscore the importance of property size, condition, and features such as the number of rooms, bathrooms, and car spaces in determining market value. Moreover, research by Wang et al. (2018) and Liu et al. (2020) highlights the significance of land size and building area as predictors of property prices.
	
	Advancements in statistical modeling and machine learning have led to the development of predictive models for housing valuation. Research by Kim et al. (2019) and Zhao et al. (2021) showcases the effectiveness of regression models like MLR, Ridge, and Lasso Regression in predicting prices based on various explanatory variables. Principal Component Regression (PCR) has also gained popularity for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction, as seen in studies by Zhang and Chen (2018) and Lee et al. (2020).
	
	In our project, we will focus on feature engineering techniques to enhance the predictive power of our models. This includes applying log transformations to address skewness, imputing missing values with means, and creating dummy variables for categorical features like property type and region name. Instead of PCA, we will use PCR for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. Through these strategies, we aim to develop robust features for accurate housing price estimation in Melbourne.
	
	\section {Methodology}
	\subsection{Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)}
	In the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) phase, our primary objective was to thoroughly explore and understand the dataset before proceeding with further analysis. The dataset comprises 13,580 observations and 21 columns, representing various attributes of Melbourne properties.
	
	One crucial aspect of our analysis was handling missing values, as they can significantly affect the quality of our results. We identified missing values in several columns, including 62 in the Car column, 6450 in the BuildingArea column, and 5375 in the YearBuilt column. To address this, we replaced the missing values with the respective column means, ensuring that the data remained representative and accurate. 	
	
	Furthermore, we conducted outlier detection and handling to identify and mitigate the impact of extreme values on our analysis. Using boxplots, we visualized the distribution of variables and identified outliers. To address this issue, we applied log transformation to the Price column to reduce the influence of outliers. Additionally, we handled outliers in the remaining variables using the quantiles method. (refer to Figure \ref{fig:boxplot} and Figure \ref{fig:haihinh})
		
	The correlation analysis of the Melbourne housing dataset reveals several key relationships among its variables. Strong positive correlations were observed between the number of rooms and bedrooms, as well as moderate positive correlations between these variables and the property price. Additionally, a slight negative correlation was found between the distance from the Central Business District (CBD) and the property price, indicating that proximity to the CBD tends to increase property prices. Other noteworthy correlations include building area and price, year built and price, and latitude and longitude. (refer to Figure \ref{fig:heatmap})
	
	To proceed, we will first create dummy variables for the "Type" and "Region name" feature and remove redundant or irrelevant features from the dataset, including "Suburb", "Address", "Method", "SellerG", "Date", "Postcode", "CouncilArea".
	
	Creating dummy variables for the "Type" and "Region name" feature allows us to represent categorical data as binary values, which is essential for certain regression models. Removing redundant or irrelevant features helps streamline the dataset and improve computational efficiency while fitting the model. Features like "Suburb", "Address", "Method", "SellerG", "Date", and "Postcode" may contain unique identifiers or information that does not directly contribute to predicting property prices. Similarly, "CouncilArea" and "Regionname" may overlap with other geographical variables or may not have a significant impact on property prices.
	
	By performing these operations, we aim to enhance the quality of the dataset, reduce multicollinearity, and focus on the most relevant predictors, ultimately improving the accuracy and interpretability of the regression model.
	
	\subsection{Perform Multiple Linear Regression}
	
	During this phase of our project, we conducted multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis using 10-fold cross-validation to predict housing prices based on diverse features present in the Melbourne housing dataset. Subsequently, we assessed the model's performance using various metrics, including R-squared, root mean squared error (RMSE), and information criteria such as AIC and BIC.
	
	The obtained metrics from the MLR model suggest promising outcomes. The R-squared value, approximately 0.734, indicates that approximately 73.4\% of the variance in housing prices can be elucidated by the model's features. Additionally, the RMSE, approximately 0.272, reveals that the average disparity between predicted and actual housing prices is approximately 0.272.
	
	Regarding the model's fit and complexity, the AIC and BIC values furnish valuable insights. The AIC, around 2891.48, and BIC, approximately 3054.52, illustrate the balance between model adequacy and complexity. (refer to Figure \ref{fig:mlr})
	
		
	\subsection{Ridge Regression}
	In this phase, we conducted ridge regression analysis to predict housing prices using the Melbourne housing dataset. First, we separated numerical variables from dummy variables. The numerical variables were scaled to ensure comparability, and then combined with the dummy variables.
	
	Next, we split the data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split. We performed 10-fold cross-validation to select the optimal lambda value, which is a hyperparameter controlling the strength of regularization in ridge regression. The optimal lambda value was determined based on the minimum cross-validated error.
	
	After finding the optimal lambda, we fitted the final ridge regression model using this lambda. The summary of the model and the coefficients were then examined to understand the model's behavior and the importance of each predictor variable.
	
	Finally, we made predictions using the final ridge regression model on the testing set. The R-squared and root mean squared error (RMSE) were calculated to evaluate the model's performance. The R-squared value measures the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model, while the RMSE quantifies the average deviation between predicted and actual housing prices.
	
	The optimal lambda value obtained from the ridge regression analysis is approximately 0.0542. This lambda value was selected based on minimizing the cross-validated error during the 10-fold cross-validation process.
	
	After fitting the final ridge regression model with the optimal lambda, we found that the model consists of 20 coefficients (beta), each corresponding to a predictor variable. The R-squared value, measuring the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model, is approximately 0.730. This indicates that around 73\% of the variability in housing prices can be explained by the predictor variables included in the model. Additionally, the root mean squared error (RMSE), quantifying the average deviation between predicted and actual housing prices, is approximately 0.529. This suggests that, on average, the model's predictions deviate by approximately $0.529$ from the actual housing prices. (refer to Figure \ref{fig:ridge})
		
	\subsection{LASSO}
	
	Next, we applied LASSO regression to predict housing prices based on various features available in the Melbourne housing dataset, similar to the approach used for Ridge regression. LASSO regression helps in feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero, effectively performing variable selection alongside regularization.
	
	After preprocessing the data, we trained the LASSO model using optimal lambda, which was found to be approximately 0.001168357. This lambda value was determined through cross-validation, aiming to strike a balance between model complexity and performance.
	
	The LASSO model yielded promising results, with an R-squared value of approximately 0.7300156, indicating that around 73.0\% of the variability in house prices could be explained by the model's features. Additionally, the root mean squared error (RMSE) was approximately 0.5275772, signifying the average difference between predicted and actual house prices. (refer to Figure \ref{fig:lasso})
	
		\subsection{Subset selection}
	We conduct subset selection on the "Melb-house" dataset to identify the most effective combination of independent variables for our linear regression model. Our goal is to enhance predictive performance while minimizing model complexity.
	
	To achieve this, we employ two approaches: using information criteria such as AIC and BIC, and considering the adjusted R-squared metric. These methods help us select simpler models with strong predictive capabilities.
	
	Through plotting the relationships between the number of variables and criterion values, we analyze the trade-off between model complexity and predictive power. This enables us to select the optimal subset of independent variables for our linear regression model, ultimately improving its overall performance.
	
	The adjusted R-squared value remains stable at approximately 0.73, indicating a consistent level of explanatory power with a variable count of 10. Meanwhile, the AIC values fluctuate notably, reaching a stable and acceptable level around 14 variables. In contrast, the BIC values stabilize at approximately 11 variables.
			
	\subsection{PCR}
	n this phase, we utilized Principal Component Regression (PCR) to model house prices based on predictors from the Melbourne housing dataset. PCR combines Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with linear regression to reduce predictor space dimensionality.
	
	We fitted a PCR model using the pcr() function from the 'pls' package. With Price ~ ., we predicted 'Price' based on other variables. Setting scale = TRUE scaled predictors. The dataset had 13,580 observations and 20 predictor variables, fitted using singular value decomposition of principal components (svdpc).
	
	Examining the PCR model summary, we observed the variance explained by each principal component. Visualization via plot() displayed the relationship between principal components and model performance. Predictions were made on the original data.
	
	Model performance was evaluated by calculating Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), indicating the average difference between predicted and actual prices. Further analysis included cross-validation with pcr() using "CV". Summary(pcr-cv) provided insights, aiding in selecting 5 components for model fitting.
	
	The results indicate that the PCR model with 5 components explains 56.76\% of the variance in the predictor variables (X) and 62.05\% of the variance in the response variable (Price). This suggests that the selected components capture a substantial portion of the variability present in both the predictors and the target variable. (refer to Figure \ref{fig:pcr})
	
		\subsection{Residual Analysis}
	
	In the next step, we will conduct residual analysis on the best models derived from the aforementioned methods, including multiple regression (MLR), Ridge regression, Lasso regression, and Subset selection. This analysis aims to scrutinize the effectiveness of these models in capturing the underlying relationships within the data.
	
	Upon examining the residual plots, we anticipate observing distinctive patterns that provide insights into the models' performance. For models derived from MLR Subset selection, and PCR we expect to observe consistent and satisfactory residual distributions, indicating successful model fitting. (refer to Figure \ref{fig:MS} and Figure \ref{fig:rapcr})
	
	However, for models derived from Ridge and Lasso regression, we anticipate encountering a particular pattern resembling a butterfly or bowtie shape in the residual plots. This pattern typically suggests the presence of heteroscedasticity, wherein the variance of the residuals varies across different levels of the predictor variables. (refer to Figure \ref{fig:RL})
	
	\section{Result and discussion}
	After performing 10-fold cross-validation for multiple regression methods including MLR, Ridge, LASSO, Subset Selection, and PCR, we have identified the optimal model and conducted a comparison based on the adjusted R-squared, RMSE, AIC, and BIC metrics. The results are summarized in the table below.

	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		  & $R^{2}_{adj}$ & RMSE & AIC & BIC \\
		\hline

		\hline
		Subset & 0.731 & 0.263 & 2781.189 & 2944.231 \\

		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
	\\
	In addition to the summary of results, here are some further observations. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Effectiveness of Regularization}: Ridge and LASSO, regularization techniques, perform similarly with higher RMSE compared to MLR and Subset Selection. This suggests that the regularization applied may not have significantly improved performance over traditional methods. Ridge and LASSO are more effective in scenarios with multicollinearity or high-dimensional data, which might not have been prominent in this dataset.
		
		\item \textbf{Model Selection and Evaluation}: PCR shows the lowest Adjusted R-squared but is a viable option for dimensionality reduction. Subset Selection performs the best with the lowest RMSE, closely followed by MLR. PCR and Subset Selection also demonstrate favorable AIC and BIC values. Ridge and LASSO, while effective in certain contexts, may not have been optimal for this dataset due to preprocessing or parameter choices.
		
		\item \textbf{Recommendation}: Subset Selection appears suitable based on overall metrics. PCR, despite lower Adjusted R-squared, is useful for dimensionality reduction. Ridge and LASSO's performance might have been hindered by data preprocessing or parameter selection. Further exploration into parameter tuning and preprocessing techniques could enhance the performance of these methods
