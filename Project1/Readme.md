              	House Pricing Prediction in Melbourne
This project focuses on building predictive models to estimate house prices in Melbourne, Australia. The analysis includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, relationships, and outliers in the dataset.
- Model Building: Implementing Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), LASSO, Ridge Regression, and Principal Component Regression (PCR) to predict house prices.
- Model Evaluation: Comparing model performance using metrics such as RMSE, R-squared, and cross-validation scores.
- Feature Engineering: Applying feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques to enhance model accuracy.
- The project was completed using R programming with tools such as tidyverse, glmnet, caret, and ggplot2.
