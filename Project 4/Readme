This project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling, with a focus on real-world applications in the hospitality industry.
-  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted in-depth EDA on multiple datasets, including "Hotel Booking Demand" and "Hotel Reviews," to uncover trends, patterns, and insights on customer preferences, booking behavior, and market dynamics.
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Applied various data wrangling techniques in Python, including handling missing values, data type conversions, and feature engineering to prepare datasets for analysis and modeling.
-  Predictive Modeling: Developed and evaluated predictive models using machine learning algorithms to forecast future hotel bookings, applying techniques such as regression, classification, and time series forecasting.
-  Feature Selection and Engineering: Identified and selected key features impacting booking behavior, performing feature engineering to improve model performance and accuracy.
-  Model Evaluation: Employed evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and accuracy to assess the performance of the predictive models.
-  Data Visualization: Utilized Python libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly to create visualizations that provided insights into booking patterns, customer segments, and seasonal trends.
-  Integration of Multiple Datasets: Combined multiple datasets (hotel bookings and reviews) while ensuring proper matching and integration for a more comprehensive analysis.
- Programming in Python: Leveraged Python for data analysis and machine learning, utilizing libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and xgboost to implement various stages of the project.
- Business Insights and Recommendations: Generated actionable business insights from the data analysis to help hotel management improve service offerings, resource allocation, and customer experience.
