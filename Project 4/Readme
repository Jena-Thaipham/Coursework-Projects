This project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling, with a focus on real-world applications in the hospitality industry.
-  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted thorough EDA on "Hotel Booking Demand" and "Hotel Reviews" datasets, identifying trends and key patterns in booking behavior and customer preferences.
-  Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Applied data cleaning techniques such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features to prepare the data for modeling. Performed feature selection and engineering to improve model accuracy.
-  Machine Learning Algorithms:
•	Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification tasks to predict booking outcomes based on customer and booking data.
•	k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN): Applied for classification tasks to predict whether a customer would make a booking based on their similarity to other customers.
•	Decision Tree Classifier: Built decision tree models to understand how different features influence booking decisions.
•	Random Forest Classifier: Implemented an ensemble of decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.
•	Gradient Boosting Classifier: Applied gradient boosting techniques to combine weak models and boost predictive power.
•	Extra Trees Classifier: Utilized this ensemble method to build a robust classifier by aggregating predictions from many deep, random trees.
- Model Evaluation:
•	Evaluated model performance using classification metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1 score to ensure balanced model evaluation.
•	Focused on handling class imbalance and improving the model's ability to correctly classify minority class instances (e.g., predicting whether a booking will occur).
-  Data Visualization: Visualized key patterns and model performance metrics using libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly, providing clear insights into booking trends and model evaluation results.
- Model Tuning and Hyperparameter Optimization: Fine-tuned hyperparameters for models (e.g., decision tree depth, kNN neighbors) to optimize performance and prevent overfitting.
-  Python Programming: Utilized Python and key libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and xgboost to implement machine learning models, evaluate performance, and visualize results.
-  Business Insight and Application: Leveraged predictive models to provide actionable insights for hotel management, enabling more accurate forecasting and better resource allocation.
